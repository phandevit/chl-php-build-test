# Click Here Labs PHP Build Test

Create a PHP application that allows logged in users to create products and approve or reject reviews left by anonymous users on the products.

## Requirements

* You must be built using the Laravel PHP framework.
* You must fork this repository and and send your completed project as a single pull request.
* Your project must be deployed to either a Heroku instance or an Amazon EC2 instance.
* A default user must be created when seeding the database.
* No user registration is allowed.
* Only logged in users can create products.
* Anyone, logged in or not can create a product review.
* Newly created reviews must not show up on products immediately. They must first be approved by a logged in user.
* Reviews must have at least a text field for comments and a number field for a rating.
* Products must show their average rating if they have any reviews.
* Just to be clear: there does not need to be a way to "purchase" a product.
* Use a JSON file to store the products instead of a database.

## Nice to Haves

* Presentation isn't everything but some styling should be present, Bootstrap without any customization is fine.
* Pagination of products.
* It'd be nice if people could see what the product looked like, allowing photo uploads is a great idea.
* Sorting products by rating or price (or any other attributes you can think might be relevant to a customer).
* Search and filtering of products.


## What We're Looking For

* Code quality. Not just the style, but overall organization and proper use of abstrations.
* Test coverage. 100% is overkill, 0% is dangerous.
* Demonstration of knowledge of the tools of the trade.
* Speed. This test should take between 3 and 6 hours over the course of 1 to 3 days.
* Creativity. Feel free to polish the application as much as you want in the time you have. Additional features that make sense in conjunction with the requirements are more than welcome.
* Documentation. Don't tell us what or how, tell us why. Especially if it's not immediately obvious.
